# managing_pkgs_w_npm
npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.  In this course, you'll learn the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.
